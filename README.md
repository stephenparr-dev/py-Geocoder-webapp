# py-Geocoder-webapp
A web-based Geocoder application that will return the latitude and longitude of a given address

This was the final project exercise for the Udemy Python Mega Course which was undertaken with minimal guidance other than being shown what the final application should be capable of doing.
It utilises elements of HTML and CSS alongside the Python code itself (flask, pandas and the geopy geocoder)

The Jupyter Notebook file contains exploratory tests that I conducted whilst building the application in order to see what would work and what wouldn't, and to document these tests for future reference.

I have a copy of the application currently hosted on an account with Heroku.
